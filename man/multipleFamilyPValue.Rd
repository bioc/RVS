\title{probability of sharing of rare variants in a subset of families}
\usage{
multipleFamilyPValue(sharingProbs, observedSharing, minPValue = 0,
  backend = "cpp")
}
\arguments{
\item{sharingProbs}{named vector of sharing probabilties, where names
correspond to famid value of pedigree}

\item{observedSharing}{boolean vector describing if all affected subjects
in the family share the variant (TRUE if all share)}

\item{minPValue}{the minimum p-value threshold, once the true p-value is
determined to be less than this, the computation stops and minPValue is
returned - this prevents extremely long computations for extremely small
p-values}

\item{backend}{either 'cpp' or 'r', determines which back-end is used. This parameter
is intended for use by developers of the RVS package}
}
\value{
P-value of the exact rare variant sharing test requiring
sharing by all affected subjects
}
\description{
Computing probability of sharing of rare variants in
a subset of families where rare variants are seen based on precomputed
family-specific rare variant sharing probabilities.
}
\details{
All the subsets of families of size equal or inferior to the
length of not are created, and the joint probability of each such
subset not sharing a rare variant and the remaining families sharing
a rare variant is obtained as the product of the family-specific rare
variant sharing probabilities or its complement. The function then sums
the pattern probabilities inferior or equal to the probability
of the observed pattern of the not families not sharing a rare variant
and the remaining families sharing a rare variant.
